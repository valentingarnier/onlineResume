My team and I developed a robust journey planner for the ZÃ¼rich area during a lab in Data Science. 
Using the SBB CFF FFS (Swiss public transport) data, we modeled the public transport infrastructure as a graph considering walks, transfers and historical delays of every transportations over 2 years.
Our algorithm was able to predict the fastest route to go from A to B in a way to maximize your chances to be on time!

It was a great opportunity to learn more about PySpark, Hive, discover bokeh, ipywidgets and apply graph algorithms on a real life problem!
