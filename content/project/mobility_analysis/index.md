GPS devices and wireless communication technologies generate a lot of data. Consequently, pro-cessing and analyzing spatial behaviors is becoming a topic of interest. In this project, we propose a pipeline for processing raw GPS data points. Firstly, we aim to clean the data, then to create routes and split points between activities and trips. Secondly, we detect the mode of transportation for trips and we propose a method to find the home and work places for each user. Finally, we provide a confidence measure on the trajectories found.
