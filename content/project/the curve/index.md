I took the opportunity to bring some happiness in peopleâ€™s homes for a night: The Curve Festival ðŸŽ¶

As an engineer student, I had the chance to participate to LauzHack, a hackathon organized at EPFL with the idea of improving everyday life during the Covid-19 crisis. 
During this 72-hour hackathon, I brainstormed with my wonderful team about potential ideas and in two weeks, we built a platform and organized the online music festival. People had the possibility to go from one stage to another, interact and comment live while enjoying the 16 artists' exhibitions over 3 virtual stages.

Thanks to this project, we raised over 2500$ for the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund campaign for the World Health Organization.
