This project involves the design and implementation of defenses against website fingerprintability, an issue that allows an adversary to become acquainted with the website that the client is visiting by analyzing traffic patterns that are unique to each website.
We implemented a defense based on padding with different strategies. we proceeded data collections on all the strategies in order to analyse results. The results showed that padding on request only is not enough since a classifier has still been able to discover 69\% of the website analysed. However, padding on both request and response proved itself effective but has some cons.

During this project, I discovered the Go Language and a lot of privacy techniques!
