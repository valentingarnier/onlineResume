In this project we designed and implemented a database system based on AirBnbâ€™s dataset.
We also had to develop a user-friendly application. 
This was a great opportunity to master python, mongoDB, Oracle, SQL. In particular for SQL where I made complexe queries on the database. 

This was a first taste of how a real database system looks like in real life.
