My team and I made one of the best project: we decided to visualize the color of songs with a dynamic and interactive colorwheel. 
We analyzed the lyrics from songs between 1960 and 2015. 
On the application you have the possibility to switch to a histogram, filter songs, search by artist and listen to the particular song on Spotify!

During the project I had the opportunity to learn more about javascript and the D3 library!
