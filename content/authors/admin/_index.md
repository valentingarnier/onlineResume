Hello! I am Valentin, a Data Science Master student from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch). I am from Tahiti and I moved to Switzerland for my studies. I enjoy solving problems using new technologies and using data to optimize business decisions. I am currently looking for Data Science or Machine Learning internships!
